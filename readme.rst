The original challenge (Quoted from Prof. Michael Murphy)
=========================================================
The challenge:
– Identify new papers on arXiv which include current (& recent former) CAS members as co-authors.
– Minimise false-positives/negatives by checking basic versions of CAS member names and identifying affiliation information.
– Serve basic paper information in a format (TBD) useful for a CAS-wide "noticeboard"/database, record and inclusion in the "At CAS this week" emails.
– A label showing submission status, where available, e.g. "Accepted", "Submitted", "Published" or "Unknown" (derived from the Comments field in arXiv, most likely).
– Preferably run each day & collated weekly.
– Preferably the database could be edited by CAS members to correct anything, delete false-positives, add false-negatives and add/update status if desired.
